## About this project ##
This project is a showcase of my recent work. I was thinking about what is the best way to share all my creativity and ideas. So, I came to the idea to create my own "portal" where I will publish everything that I am planning to do in my future life and career (teaching, bloggin, experimenting). I have spent one month on building this website, though most of the time I spend on 3D modeling in **Blender** (i didn't have this skill).

For building this website I was using **node.js** with **express** for the server side and **mongodb** for the database. It is the first beta version, so I promise it will be updated soon.
